# Guess-the-word-Game-using-C-
This project implements a console-based word guessing game in C++ where the user must guess the name of a country based on hidden letters, similar to the classic Hangman game. It is designed to enhance logical thinking and familiarity with world geography through an engaging terminal-based interface.
